Project Name: 30 Minute Film Festival
Project Description: This project showcases a film that we created in class. I wanted the user to be able to view the film and get information about the film and the crew. 
Process: I made the website using HTML, added design to it using css, and tried to add interactivity using Javascript. Using Javascript, I wanted to highlighted the play button on the video and deliver crew info to user as they hover their mouse over the pictures of the crew. 
Reflection/Evaluation: My javascript codes are not properly running. There is a problem in the linkage between the HTML code and the JS code. I was not able to debug it and as a result it messed up my web layout.
